# TODO: no die's!  need to all call common bail() infrastructure so we can reset cleanly

# TODO: triage old TODOs:

# [OLD] TODO: if a branch fails to read during a run we should prompt for resolution (options are at least abort and skip)
# [OLD] TODO: actually several failures (e.g.  any convert_commitlike) could probably stand for more graceful handling

# [OLD] TODO: put branch comments in linear rebases indicating where branches were

# [OLD] TODO: for correctness in the face of GC we need to checkpoint any commit we plan on using, probably with a branch like zzz-TS-rebase-checkpoint-SHA1, not sure about what's best for cleaning these guys up

# [OLD] TODO: handle empty commits (if we get set up to do an empty commit it probably means the user wants a skip)

# [OLD] TODO: real messages before each shell invocation indicating expected state and obvious options
