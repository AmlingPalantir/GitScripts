    resolvers
        split?
            to give other resolvers a better shot at pieces...
            e.g.  split 1,1,2?
                is almost certainly gonna require better command specification/parsing
        [something to] handle touching prefix/suffix, e.g.  (ABc,abc,abC) -> (ABC) or (AB,A,) -> (B)
        [something to] handle indent conflict better by semimatching projected lines so we only conflict on the relevant part
            in particular we allow ("a","a"," a") -> " a" but not e.g.  ("  a","a"," a")
    help?
GRD
    various cleanup (in script as TODO)
    maybe try to figure out "already merged" changes and skip them
        too hard in general case...
        git machinery is an absolute mess (rev-list --cherry-pick)
        git-cherry?!
    allow return to editting script at some failure points
        ideally we'd dump the saved map, stack, etc.  into the script and so just drop state and run the new script from the beginning
GBD
    track good/bad sets and be able to view the history (similar to "git bisect log")
