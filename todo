    handle touching prefix/suffix, e.g.  (ABc,abc,abC) -> (ABC) or (AB,A,) -> (B)
    handle indent conflict better by semimatching projected lines so we only conflict on the relevant part
        in particular we allow ("a","a"," a") -> " a" but not e.g.  ("  a","a"," a")
    even allow programmatic projections?!
    conflict blocks should probably show the smallest pair-wise diff and the other
        if M-L is smallest show R first as result plus M-L unified as reference for change
        if L-R is smallest show R-L first as result plus M as reference ... for nothing?
    blocking?
        hmm, it's like a 3-way version of longest subseq but we actually want to be a little more careful
        in particular, X/X/Y is better than X/Y/Z but is "worse" than X/X/X
            can maybe get away with ordering options by X/Y/Z count breaking ties with X/X/Y count
G3MC[har]
    pipe conflict headers through it!
GRD
    various cleanup (in script as TODO)
    maybe try to figure out "already merged" changes and skip them
        too hard in general case...
        git machinery is an absolute mess (rev-list --cherry-pick)
    allow return to editting script at some failure points
        ideally we'd dump the saved map, stack, etc.  into the script and so just drop state and run the new script from the beginning
GBD
    track good/bad sets and be able to view the history (similar to "git bisect log")
