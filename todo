GRD
    various cleanup (in script as TODO)
    maybe try to figure out "already merged" changes and skip them
        too hard in general case...
    incorporate phantom file "fix" from git's 181264ad590ffef9d956fdd023369869c2d0a55f
        is this already fixed somehow?
    allow return to editting script at some failure points
        ideally we'd dump the saved map, stack, etc.  into the script and so just drop state and run the new script from the beginning
GBD
    track good/bad sets and be able to view the history (similar to "git bisect log")
