        [something to] handle indent conflict better by semimatching projected lines so we only conflict on the relevant part
            in particular we allow ("a","a"," a") -> " a" but not e.g.  ("  a","a"," a")
    help?
GRD
    various cleanup (in script as TODO)
    maybe try to figure out "already merged" changes and skip them
        git-cherry/git-patch-id can give us the data we need
        unclear in general case what with the multiple places we could be playing onto...
            maybe invoking cherry on each onto/plus pair and then seeding the ontos as containing those commits?
            we'd also need to have pick generate as NOP if it's already "contained" in the top
    allow return to editting script at some failure points
        ideally we'd dump the saved map, stack, etc.  into the script and so just drop state and run the new script from the beginning
GBD
    track good/bad sets and be able to view the history (similar to "git bisect log")
