    imports/sort resolver
    menu is getting unwieldy...
    abbreviations?
        c[h]
        a[uto]
    unabbreviations?
        e.g. longer form of lf
    split option?
        to give other resolvers a better shot at pieces...
        e.g.  split 1,1,2?
            is almost certainly gonna require better command specification/parsing
    old notes, cannibalize for interactive version
        handle touching prefix/suffix, e.g.  (ABc,abc,abC) -> (ABC) or (AB,A,) -> (B)
        handle indent conflict better by semimatching projected lines so we only conflict on the relevant part
            in particular we allow ("a","a"," a") -> " a" but not e.g.  ("  a","a"," a")
        even allow programmatic projections?!
        conflict blocks should probably show the smallest pair-wise diff and the other
            if M-L is smallest show R first as result plus M-L unified as reference for change
            if L-R is smallest show R-L first as result plus M as reference ... for nothing?
        blocking?
            hmm, it's like a 3-way version of longest subseq but we actually want to be a little more careful
            in particular, X/X/Y is better than X/Y/Z but is "worse" than X/X/X
                can maybe get away with ordering options by X/Y/Z count breaking ties with X/X/Y count
GRD
    various cleanup (in script as TODO)
    maybe try to figure out "already merged" changes and skip them
        too hard in general case...
        git machinery is an absolute mess (rev-list --cherry-pick)
    allow return to editting script at some failure points
        ideally we'd dump the saved map, stack, etc.  into the script and so just drop state and run the new script from the beginning
GBD
    track good/bad sets and be able to view the history (similar to "git bisect log")
