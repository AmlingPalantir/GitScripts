GRD
    various cleanup (in script as TODO)
    somehow allow multiple bases
        existing script writers can probably all do it (although with multiple bases they would not produce an --onto)
    handle empty tree commit, god damn it
    maybe try to figure out "already merged" changes and skip them
        too hard in general case...
    incorporate phantom file "fix" from git's 181264ad590ffef9d956fdd023369869c2d0a55f
        is this already fixed somehow?
    allow return to editting script at some failure points
        ideally we'd dump the saved map, stack, etc.  into the script and so just drop state and run the new script from the beginning
GBD (git-bisect-of-doom)
    use state file to allow multiple bisects to work together
    allow eval-able perl to weight commits
    probably two stage -- weight and dump history and do actual bisection stuff (to avoid repeat weight and dump for multiple bisects)
        maybe not necessary since you can copy the state file from after the initialize?
    no checkout by default (allow --checkout)
